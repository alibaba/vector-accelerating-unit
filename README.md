This is a hardware implementation to accelerate matrix and vector operations to enhance AI computation. 
This project include two parts: 
1. GEMM(verilog): to accelerate matrix operations
2. VPU(hls): to accelerate vector operations

Initial funtionality test has been finished on FPGA for both block. More validation is working in progress.
